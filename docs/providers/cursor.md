# Cursor

Tracks your Cursor plan usage using the login from the Cursor app.

## What it tracks

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Credits | Credit balance left from grants and prepaid account balance |
| Total Usage | Plan usage for the billing cycle (percent; dollars on team plans) |
| Requests | Request count vs. cap (team/enterprise accounts) |
| Auto Usage | Auto-model usage percent |
| API Usage | API usage percent |
| Extra Usage | On-demand spend; shown as a meter only when Cursor returns a limit |

When Cursor reports your plan name, OpenUsage shows it beside the provider name.

## Where credentials come from

Just be signed into the Cursor app. OpenUsage reads Cursor's local state database (and its keychain entries) for the session tokens; refreshed tokens are persisted back. Nothing extra to install or configure.

## Spend history

Today, Yesterday, Last 30 Days, and Usage Trend come from Cursor's usage export. OpenUsage uses the exported token counts and shared model pricing to estimate the cost locally. Cursor's export may occasionally arrive late, so the newest figures can lag behind current activity. OpenUsage leaves isolated malformed rows out instead of silently counting broken values as zero. A failed download, invalid export schema, or broken CSV structure leaves spend history unavailable for that refresh. Each failure is recorded in the diagnostic log without including the exported usage data.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not logged in" / token errors** — open Cursor and make sure you're signed in, then refresh.
- **Some metrics missing** — Cursor omits fields depending on plan type (e.g. Requests only exists on request-based accounts); missing metrics simply show "No data".
- **Optional lookup failed** — plan, credit-grant, prepaid-balance, and request-fallback failures stay nonfatal when primary usage is available. OpenUsage records fixed, credential-free reasons in the diagnostic log.

## Under the hood

Connect RPC on `api2.cursor.sh` (dashboard usage), REST fallback at `cursor.com/api/usage` for request-based accounts, Stripe balance at `cursor.com/api/auth/stripe`, and the usage-events CSV export at `cursor.com/api/dashboard/export-usage-events-csv`. The primary dashboard usage request refreshes the token and retries once after a 401/403; optional endpoint failures stay nonfatal and are recorded in the diagnostic log. Per-day spend imputation uses exported token counts priced through the shared [model pricing](../pricing.md); Cursor-native models (`auto`, `composer-*`, …) come from its supplement layer, which maintainers sync from [Cursor models & pricing](https://cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing.md).
